### How the script works
The script run_analysis.R does the following:
 1. load the train data set 
 2. add the name of each feature 
 3. load the activities and subjects
 4. combine train data set and labels and subjects
 5. do the same to test data as train data
 6. combine test data and train data
 7. replace all activity numbers to activity names
 8. extract only mean and standard deviation measurements
 9. generate a second, independent tidy data set group by activity and subject
